@Junior Developer Some things to consider, when tackling Objects Activity 3:

- take a look at the .join method
- take a look at the .padEnd method
- take a look at the .split method
- take a look at the .toString method
- take care when defining your food and drinks... do they need to be separate key value pairs?
- think about where you add your 'prices' carefully

These are based on one solution, of course, but have helped pervious Junior Developers. 
Don't worry if you are building a solution that doesn't use / take into account any of the above!
